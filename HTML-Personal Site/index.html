    <h3>About me</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>A member of the Council and the Keeper of "Nature," the second concept created by the Gods.</li>

        <li>She has materialized in the mortal realm as a druid in a bid to save nature.</li>

        <li>She has Kirin blood flowing in her veins, and horns that are made out of the branches of a certain tree;
            they are NOT deer antlers.</li>

        <li>"Nature" refers to all organic matter on the planet except mankind.</li>

        <li>It is long said that her whispers, as an avatar of Mother Nature, have healing properties. Whether or not
            that is true is something only those who have heard them can say.</li>

        <li>While she is usually affable, warm, and slightly mischievous, any who anger her will bear the full brunt of
            Nature's fury.</li>
    </ul>
